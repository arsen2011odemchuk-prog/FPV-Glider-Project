# Long‑Range FPV Glider – Smart RC Airplane

Project Overview
This is a long-range FPV glider equipped with GPS and camera for autonomous flight.

 Why I Made This
To learn long-range FPV flight and build a smart glider.

 Features
- GPS navigation
- FPV camera
- Stabilized flight

Build Proc
- Fuselage and wings modeled in Tinkercad.
- Battery will fit inside the fuselage (mid-section).
- FPV camera mounts at the nose.
- Servo wires run through small openings at wing roots and tail
