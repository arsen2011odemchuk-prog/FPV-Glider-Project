The configuration has been planned by INAV.

The Flight Controller is the primary component of the aircraft.
- Model: F4 V3
The firmware in question is that of the INAV.

The following section will deal with the matter of UART configuration.
- UART1: GPS (BE220 M8N)
The second Universal Asynchronous Receiver/Transmitter (UART2) is a radio receiver that utilises the iBUS.
- UART3: OSD / FPV

## Sensors
- Accelerometer: Enabled
- Barometer: Enabled
- GPS: The function has been enabled for GPS and GLONASS.

## Flight Modes
The angle has been stabilised.
- Manual
- Return-To-Home (RTH)

The configuration in question is of a failsafe nature.
- Signal loss: Trigger RTH
The phenomenon of low battery voltage is a subject that merits further investigation. Trigger RTH

## OSD Data
The battery voltage is measured and recorded.
The rate of descent is measured in miles per hour.
- Altitude
The distance from one's place of residence is a pertinent factor in this matter.
The following is a list of the GPS satellite count.
